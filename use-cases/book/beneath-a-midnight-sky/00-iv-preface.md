Preface
=======

In the stillness of night, when the world retreats into slumber, a different
kind of magic unfolds. Beneath a Midnight Sky is an exploration of the unseen,
the hidden corners of existence where dreams, fears, and truths reside. It is a
journey through shadow and light, reminding us that beneath the darkness lies
the potential for transformation and revelation.

--Elizabeth Christensen; Chicago, July, 1908
